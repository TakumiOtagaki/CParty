# Story Audit

## Story
- id: 001
- title: Normalize test harness paths and source-controlled ctest registration
- depends_on: []
- attempt: 1
- date: 2026-02-13

## Commit
- branch: feature/scfg-refactor-fixed-energy
- commit: c54a89d
- files_changed:
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - test/README.md
  - documents/ralph-loop/prd.json
  - documents/ralph-loop/audit/001.md
  - documents/ralph-loop/progress.txt

## Commands
```bash
cmake -E rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build -N
stat -f "%Sm %N" -t "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" build/CTestTestfile.cmake
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Metrics
- refactor_compared: n/a (not a refactor-only story)
- refactor_strict_mismatched: n/a (not a refactor-only story)
- alignment_compared: n/a (not an alignment story)
- alignment_mismatched: n/a (not an alignment story)
- skipped: n/a (not an alignment story)
- finite_rate: n/a (not an alignment story)

## Result
- passes: true
- rationale: Fresh build regenerated CTest files from source; `ctest -N` lists source-defined tests and full regression passed.

## Blockers
- none
