# Story Audit

## Story
- id: 002
- title: Lock mandatory seed dataset from test/multi.secstruct
- depends_on: [001]
- attempt: 1
- date: 2026-02-13

## Commit
- branch: feature/scfg-refactor-fixed-energy
- commit: 9d541a4
- files_changed:
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - test/multi_secstruct_schema_test.cc
  - test/fixtures/seed_from_multi_secstruct.tsv
  - documents/ralph-loop/prd.json
  - documents/ralph-loop/audit/002.md
  - documents/ralph-loop/progress.txt

## Commands
```bash
cmake -S . -B build_story002_fresh && cmake --build build_story002_fresh
ctest --test-dir build_story002_fresh --output-on-failure -R multi_secstruct
ctest --test-dir build_story002_fresh --output-on-failure
```

## Metrics
- refactor_compared: n/a (not a refactor-only story)
- refactor_strict_mismatched: n/a (not a refactor-only story)
- alignment_compared: n/a (not an alignment story)
- alignment_mismatched: n/a (not an alignment story)
- skipped: n/a (not an alignment story)
- finite_rate: n/a (not an alignment story)

## Result
- passes: true
- rationale: Added source-controlled parser/schema test for `test/multi.secstruct`, validated all rows are consumed and match fixture IDs/ordering/content, and passed both story-specific and full ctest gates on a fresh build directory.

## Blockers
- none
