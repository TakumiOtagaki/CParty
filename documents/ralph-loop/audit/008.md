## Story
- id: 008
- title: Extract shared constraint operations (empty-region/pair-type/validity)
- depends_on: [007]
- attempt: 1
- date: 2026-02-13

## Commands
```bash
cmake -S . -B build_story008_fresh_20260213 && cmake --build build_story008_fresh_20260213
ctest --test-dir build_story008_fresh_20260213 --output-on-failure -R can_pair_policy
ctest --test-dir build_story008_fresh_20260213 --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build_story008_fresh_20260213 -V -R api_cli_density2_energy_alignment
```

## Metrics
- refactor_compared: 152
- refactor_strict_mismatched: 43
- alignment_compared: 152
- alignment_mismatched: 43
- skipped: 0
- finite_rate: 100%

## Result
- passes: true
- rationale: Added a focused `constraint_oracle` for repeated concrete checks (empty-region, unpaired-position, pair-type admissibility), routed representative duplicated paths in both `part_func` and `pseudo_loop` through shared helpers without recurrence formula changes, and passed fresh-build story test plus full regression. Refactor non-regression holds against prior story baseline (`refactor_compared` unchanged at 152 and `refactor_strict_mismatched` unchanged at 43).

## Blockers
- none
- Pre-existing unrelated dirty/untracked paths were left untouched: `Dot.ps`, `build_review/`, `build_story003_fresh/`, `build_story004_fresh_run/`, `build_story005_fresh/`, `build_story006_fresh/`, `build_story007_fresh/`.
