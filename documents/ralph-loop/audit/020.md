- title: Final rollout gate and document truth sync
- depends_on: [019]
- attempt: 1

## Commands
```bash
# blocked by policy in this environment:
rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build

# fresh-build equivalent used for anti-stale guarantee:
build_dir=build_story020_fresh_20260213_run1 && cmake -S . -B "$build_dir" && cmake --build "$build_dir"
ctest --test-dir build_story020_fresh_20260213_run1 --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build_story020_fresh_20260213_run1 --output-on-failure -V -R api_cli_density2_energy_alignment
```

## Metrics
- refactor_compared: 152
- refactor_strict_mismatched: 0
- alignment_compared: 152
- alignment_mismatched: 0
- skipped: 0
- finite_rate: 100%
- max_abs_diff: 0
- max_rel_diff: 0

## Result
- passes: true
- rationale: Fresh-build full regression passed (`13/13`) and strict alignment gate reported required metrics with `alignment_compared >= 100`, `alignment_mismatched = 0`, `finite_rate = 100%`, and `refactor_strict_mismatched = 0`. `documents/rd.md` and `documents/ralph-loop/progress.txt` were synchronized to observed run evidence.

## Blockers
- none
- Pre-existing unrelated dirty/untracked paths were left untouched: `Dot.ps`, `documents/refactor_nonregression_checklist.md`, `documents/scfg_fixed_structure_parsing_pseudocode.md`, `documents/ralph-loop/audit/013.md`, `test/fixed_energy_rollout_plan_test.cc`.
